    Tools using NDTs</strong></h1>

  <section class="home-section">
    <h2><strong>About this App</strong></h2>
      <p>
      This application was developed to provide real-time predictions of the concrete compressive strength based on non-destructive test (NDT) results obtained either in the lab or in the field.
      The available techniques include ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) (longitudinal P-waves), rebound hammer (RH), and SonReb (UPV + RH).
      Through the various functions, users can:
      </p>

      <ul class="text-start">
        <li>
          <strong>Predict from a single NDT result&nbsp;-</strong>
          enter <em>UPV</em>, <em>rebound hammer (RH)</em>, or <em>SonReb</em> test results to get an immediate strength estimate at the test location.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluate the in-situ strength of a test region&nbsp;-</strong>
          pair core results with NDT data to evaluate an entire region in accordance with <em>EN&nbsp;13791:2019</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DT-only assessment&nbsp;-</strong>
          assess the in-situ strength of a test region using destructive tests (DTs) on cores by themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      These analyses can help researchers and practitioners understand the material properties of elements earmarked for reuse or of existing structures under assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Compression strengths are normalised to a <strong>300 Ã— 150 mm</strong> reference cylinder. All predictions are generated by CatBoost regression models, each tuned with a Tree-structured Parzen 
      estimator and trained with 10-fold cross-validation. The final values you see are the average of the 10 models. The models have the following characteristics: 
      </p>
      <p>
      Across each tab, several fields are optional to fit situations where this information is unknown. However, the more information that is included before running the analysis, 
      the stronger the models will perform and the more accurate the prediction.

    <h2><strong>About the Project</strong></h2>
      <p>
      The international ReCreate project is a 2020 Horizon Europe-funded programme that explores the complete structural reuse of precast concrete elements in new building constructions. 
      ReCreate's objective is to assess and improve the technical feasibility of a circular life cycle for structural precast elements, covering the entire value chain - 
      from disassembly and quality control, demountability, connections, structural and architectural designs for reuse and reconstruction. 
      The project involves an academic and industry consortium across Sweden, Germany, Finland, Croatia and the Netherlands. 
      </p>
      <p>    
      This web application is part of the ReCreate project's ongoing investment to assess the properties and quality of materials prior to reconstruction, 
      reducing uncertainty and maximising the potential for circular design. More information regarding ongoing projects and research can be found at the ReCreate website: 
      <a href="https://recreate-project.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://recreate-project.eu/</a>.

    <h2><strong>Individual Predictions</strong></h2>
      <p>
      This tab enables users to estimate the compressive strength at a specific location relative to where an NDT was performed. 
      </p>
      <p>
      After selecting the NDT technique, fill in all required fields and any optional fields where the information is known. 
      Clicking the green predict button will then generate a prediction of the normalised compressive strength. 
      If the strength is expected to fall within the domains mentioned in <strong>Table 1</strong>, then the predictions will have confidence metrics given to Table 1 also.
      </p>

  <section class="home-section">
    <h2><strong>Test Region Analysis</strong></h2>
    <p>
     This part of the app helps you evaluate the in-situ compressive strength of a defined test region using both methods laid out by EN&nbsp;13791:2019 - DT and NDT combined, or DT alone. 
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Combined DT + NDT</strong></h3>
      <p>
      This workflow calibrates pairs of direct core tests and indirect NDT measurements from the <em>same locations</em>, allowing NDTs to be extended across the rest of the test region. 
      The analysis is completed through the following steps:
      </p>

      <ul class="text-start">
        <li>
          <strong>Feature information&nbsp;-</strong>
          fill in the project, concrete, and test-setup fields. It's assumed these parameters remain constant over the whole test region. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calibration set (n)&nbsp;-</strong>
          test pairs must be performed at the same or directly equivalent location for accurate calibration. 
          EN 13971:2019 requires a minimum of 8 test pairs for calibrations in normal sized test regions. 
          Enter each core's raw compression strength plus its dimensions - the app normalised everything to a 300x150 mm cylinder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional NDTs (m)&nbsp;-</strong>
          list extra NDT readings made anywhere else in the region to extend the in-situ compressive strength estimates. 
          For valid statistical results, at least 3 additional NDTs must be performed. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After entering data into all the required fields or pasting from Excel, clicking the <strong>Analyse</strong> button will evaluate the test region based on two calibration methods:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Local Calibration:</strong> Linear regression as per EN&nbsp;13791:2019 guidelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Calibration:</strong> Based on the global predictive ability of each NDT technique using the datasets and optimised machine-learning models introduced in Table&nbsp;1.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The concrete properties are assumed to be lognormally distributed. 
        The model predictions, distribution properties, coefficient of variation, and estimated characteristic strength are given for each calibration method.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's generally accepted that local calibration can provide good results for small datasets, as the variance within each NDT significantly increases as more data is aggregated. 
       Otherwise, global calibration can typically provide more <em>consistent</em> and <em>reliable</em> results for larger datasets, given that: they <strong>follow the global trend</strong>
       and fall <strong>inside the training data ranges</strong> given in Table 1. Hence, global calibration tends to perform poorly for high-strength concretes.
       To help navigate this, both the local linear and global distributions are plotted along with their full statistical results, so the user can decide which they find more confidence in. 
       It should again be stressed that the more optional fields that are completed, the better these global models perform. The global models are also much more sensitive to small changes in certain variables,
       since they were trained on 17 input variables each for UPV and RH, and 22 for SonReb.
       Further technical details, performance metrics, and limitations are discussed in the journal paper linked above.
      </p>
  </section>

  <section class="home-section">
    <h3><strong>DT Only</strong></h3>
      <p>
        For cases when NDTs are not required and no calibration is necessary, the in-situ compressive strength of the test region can be evaluated through destructive testing alone. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Fill in the table by inserting the core dimensions are raw compression test results for normalisation and hit the <strong>Analyse</strong> button - 
        this will return the statistical results of the test region including the coefficient of variation, estimated characteristic strength, and bias factor - 
        giving you a clear statistical snapshot of the concrete in the test region.
      </p>
